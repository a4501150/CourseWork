Require Junit to perform unit test. All .java that end with Test is unit test file for each class.
###Build
It is great that we could directly import this project into eclipse
Using "import" feature in eclipse 
(I believe it is easy for Instructor or Team in company to do this)

###Check out with command line and run:
git clone https://github.com/a4501150/CS445
